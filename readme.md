# WKP8

Hello team! Here's the weekend project 8.

We're going to build a hit parade.

### Student report :

1. Structure of my code: The project was fun to play. Firstly I created the form html. After that, I worked with generating all list of songs, then, I grabed the form element and created a new objet form the user's input and push it to the mama array `songs`. 
Secondly I worked with the updating element, to do that, I used method `find()` to find the matches element and increment its score by one each click. When that was finished, I deleted a list, I used `filter()` method to filter the array and only take the ones which did not get clicked. By the end, I worked in the filter fieled, this one was the most engaging part 🔥, Finaly, Stored the lists of songs to the local storage. All of the most of the requirement seems to work fine.

2. If I had more time, firstly, I would probably find a better way to refactor the filter working area, it's not `DRY`, After that, some names are not good so I'd probably look after them. Added more style, the web is not well styled.

3. Yes, I did learn something here, Firstly, I kind of know how the local storage work now. Many others but that was the biggest to me today.

4. The most challenging part for me was the filter fieled indeed, It was not really well done, I was tricked while I was dealing with the local storage. Finally, it was worked out.

5. Specific part I would like to explain, I am always struggle with passing argument from a function to an other function.

6. Any other comments: The project was fun to play, it's burning 🔥. I mean tough but cool. 🎶🎵🎼🎹🎧🎷🎺🎸🎻🎙📻🥁
